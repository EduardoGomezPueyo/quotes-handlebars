# Quotes Handlebars
Simple web app using express handlebars that displays the most liked quotes from the registered users stored in a MongoDB database.
[Check it out!](https://quotes-handlebars.herokuapp.com/quotes/public)

## What I learned
I build this app with the intetion of improving my portfolio and skillset. On the process of building it, I learned:
- Express as a web framework
- Using mongoose as an ORM for MongoDB
- Deployment using Heroku and MongoDB Atlas
- Structuring the code for web applications
- Login strategies using passport
- Basic testing with jest
- Basic CI with CircleCI

## Next steps
I will want to investigate further: 
- TDD as an approach to work
- Using CI from the start
- Security for web applications
